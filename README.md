# Unhandled JSON Decoding Exception in Asynchronous Dart

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart applications involving asynchronous operations and JSON handling.  The `bug.dart` file showcases the problematic code, which fails to correctly handle exceptions that may occur during JSON decoding and provides insufficient error reporting.  The `bugSolution.dart` file presents a corrected version with robust error handling and more informative logging.
